Welcome to Demo1 Sphinx documentation!
======================================

:ref:`Sphinx <gettingstarted>` makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation.

Here are some of Sphinxâ€™s major features:

#. Output formats: HTML (including Windows HTML Help), LaTeX (for printable PDF versions), ePub, Texinfo, manual pages, plain text

#. Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links for functions, classes, citations, glossary terms and similar pieces of information

#. Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic links to siblings, parents and children

#. Automatic indices: general index as well as a language-specific module indices

#. Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter

#. Extensions: automatic testing of code snippets, inclusion of docstrings from Python modules (API docs) via built-in extensions, and much more functionality via third-party extensions.
